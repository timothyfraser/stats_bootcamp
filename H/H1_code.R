# JFK attempted to reduce departure delays in the year 2013.
# Looking at the 5 carriers with largest volume of flights,
# were there statistically significant differences in departure delays by carrier in April?

# Get just flights in 2013
data = flights %>% 
  filter(year == 2013) %>%
  filter(carrier %in% c("UA", "B6", "EV", "DL", "AA")) %>%
  select(carrier, dep_delay) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay))


# Does the airline significantly affect / explain variation in departure delay times?

# Descriptively answer the question.
# Do the average departure delay times vary by airline?
data %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  reframe(mean = mean(dep_delay))

data %>%
  reframe(mean = mean(dep_delay))

# Is this difference actually statistically significant? 


# Compare group variances. Are the variances significantly different?
# Are the variances of my 3+ groups significantly different?
# Homogeneity of Variance - Barlett's test for K^2
bartlett.test(formula = dep_delay ~ carrier, data = data)



# K-squared is a ratio showing how different are the variances, from 0 to infinity.
# If K-squared is not significant, the differences are not significant.

# Looks like the differences in variance are quite significant.
# Best **not** to assume equal variance.



# You can do an ANOVA without the equal variance assumption using oneway.test()
# set var.equal = FALSE if no equal variance assumption.
m = oneway.test(formula = dep_delay ~ carrier, data = data, var.equal = FALSE)

# if equal variance assumption, set var.equal = TRUE
# m = oneway.test(dep_delay ~ carrier, data = data, var.equal = TRUE)

# Airline carrier has a statistically significant relationship with departure delays.
# Departure delay means vary significantly by airline carrier.
