# P/P1_code.R
# Optimization - Maximium Likelihood Estimation

# We're going to try to estimate parameters with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

# This tutorial will introduce you to Fitting Distribution Parameters in R,
# teaching you how to use the fitdistr() function from the MASS package in R.
#
# Often, we might want to approximate statistics describing the shape of 
# distributions, but there may not be a clear analytical method (eg. method 
# of moments) to do so. We can use the power of optimization to help us 
# instead, using a brute-force method to find the value most likely to be the 
# statistic that actually fits our distribution. We can ask R to compute the 
# values of those statistics using the MASS package's fitdistr().
#
# Please open up your project on Posit.Cloud, for our Github class repository
# (https://github.com/timothyfraser/sysen). Start a new R script 
# (File >> New >> R Script). Save the R script as appendix_fitdistr.R. 
# And let's get started!


# ============================================================================
# Getting Started
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Load Packages
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Load dplyr, which contains most data wrangling functions
library(dplyr)

# Load the fitdistr() function directly from the MASS package. 
# We'll do this, rather than loading the whole MASS package, because MASS 
# will cancel out some dplyr functions that share the same names otherwise. 
# See how fitdistr has now shown up in your environment as a function?
fitdistr = MASS::fitdistr


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Our Data
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# As our raw data, let's use our vector of seawall heights sw. 
# Its raw distribution can be visualized with hist(sw).

# Let's remake again our vector of seawall heights
sw = c(4.5, 5, 5.5, 5, 5.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6, 5, 4)
hist(sw)


# ============================================================================
# Example: Exponential Distribution
# ============================================================================

# We have our vector of seawall heights sw. We have 2 main ways of 
# calculating statistics that describe the distribution of sw. These include 
# an analytical approach (method of moments) and a brute-force approach 
# (maximum likelihood estimation).
#
# - In the analytical approach (method of moments), which we learned in the 
#   main textbook, we use formula that have been derived by mathematicians 
#   to describe the parameters of a particular distribution.
#
# - In the brute-force approach (maximum likelihood estimation), we use a 
#   secondary parameter called likelihood to find the parameter values most 
#   likely to fit your data. We say, if the parameter had value A (for 
#   example), what's the joint probability (likelihood) of finding your 
#   observed values (sw) in a distribution with that trait A? We use maximum 
#   likelihood estimation to iteratively test various different values for 
#   parameter A, and choose the value that provides the highest likelihood - 
#   a.k.a. the maximum likelihood.
#
# Note: Remember: a parameter is a single number that describes a full 
# population. A statistic is a single number that describes a sample. This 
# key difference aside, the terms are largely interchangeable.
#
# Let's use the exponential distribution as a helpful example. It has one 
# parameter - rate (also known as lambda), describing 1/mean.
#
# Let's calculate the rate parameter a few ways, using (1) the method of 
# moments, (2) maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using fitdistr(), and 
# (3) maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using optim().


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Method of Moments
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's use the method of moments to find the inverse mean
1 / (sum(sw) / length(sw))
# Equivalent to...
1 / mean(sw)


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MLE with fitdistr()
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's ask fitdistr to run maximum likelihood estimation.
#
# Maximum likelihood estimation requires a benchmark distribution to compare 
# against, so we need to specify the distribution type as densfun = [type name]. 
# In this case, let's do exponential. (See a list of supported distributions 
# using ?MASS::fitdistr)

sw %>% MASS::fitdistr(densfun = "exponential")

# Pretty darn similar to the value we got from the method of moments, right?


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MLE with optim()
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Alternatively, we could run maximum likelihood estimation manually, using 
# optim(). optim() is R's built in optimization function. We'll learn maximum 
# likelihood estimation a little more later in the book. The key idea is this:
#
# dexp(x = 2, rate = 0.1) gives the probability of the value x = 2 showing up 
# in an exponential distribution characterized by a parameter rate = 0.1.

dexp(x = 2, rate = 0.1)

# dexp(x = sw, rate = 0.1) gives the probabilities for each value of x if they 
# showed up in an exponential distribution characterized by a parameter 
# rate = 0.1.

# You can also pipe the values of x into dexp() like this
sw %>% dexp(rate = 0.1)

# The joint probability of these values of x occurring together is called the 
# likelihood. We can take the product using prod().

# Let's get the likelihood of these values...
sw %>% dexp(rate = 0.1) %>% prod()

# Likelihood tend to be very small numbers, so a helpful trick is to calculate 
# the log-likelihood instead, meaning the sum of logged probabilities.

# See how these two processes produce the same output?
# Get the log of probabilities multiplied together...
sw %>% dexp(rate = 0.1) %>% prod() %>% log()
# Get the sum of logged probabilities...
sw %>% dexp(rate = 0.1) %>% log() %>% sum()
# They're equivalent

# Then, we write up a short function called loglikelihood(), including two 
# inputs (1) par and (2) our data x. I added an example value 0.1 to par just 
# as a reminder for what it means.

loglikelihood = function(par = 0.1, x){ 
  dexp(x = x, rate = par) %>% log() %>% sum()   
}
# Try it!
loglikelihood(par = 0.1, x = sw)

# Finally, we run an optimizer using optim(), supplying a starting value for 
# search par = 0.1, our raw data x, and our function loglikelihood. We want to 
# maximize the loglikelihood, but optim() minimizes by default, so we'll say, 
# control = list(fnscale = -1) to flip the scale.

optim(par = c(0.1), x = sw, fn = loglikelihood, control = list(fnscale = -1))

# Compare the final parameter value against fitdistr's results! They're about 
# the same.

fitdistr(x = sw, densfun = "exponential")

# Voila! You made your own maximum likelihood estimator manually. Certainly, 
# optim() was a little more time consuming, but now you know how fitdistr truly 
# works inside!


# ============================================================================
# Applications
# ============================================================================

# Let's try applying the same general approach with fitdistr to other 
# distributions.


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Normal Distribution
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What parameter values would best describe our distribution's shape, if this 
# data were from a normal distribution? Remember, normal distributions have 
# a mean and a sd.

# Method of Moments
sw %>% mean()
sw %>% sd()
# Maximum Likelihood Estimation
sw %>% fitdistr(densfun = "normal")


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Poisson Distribution
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What parameter values would best describe our distribution's shape, if this 
# data were from a Poisson distribution? Remember, poisson distributions have 
# a lambda parameter describing the mean.

# Method of moments
sw %>% mean()
# Maximum Likelihood Estimation
sw %>% fitdistr(densfun = "poisson")


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Gamma Distribution
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What parameter values would best describe our distribution's shape, if this 
# data were from a Gamma distribution? Remember, gamma distributions have a 
# shape parameter approximately equal to mean^2/variance and a scale parameter 
# approximately equal to variance/mean.

# Method of Moments
# For shape, we want the rate of how much greater the mean-squared is than 
# the variance.
mean(sw)^2 / var(sw)

# For rate, we like to get the inverse of the variance divided by the mean.
1 / (var(sw) / mean(sw) )

# Maximum Likelihood Estimation
sw %>% fitdistr(densfun = "gamma")


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Weibull Distribution
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What parameter values would best describe our distribution's shape, if this 
# data were from a Weibull distribution? Remember, weibull distributions have 
# a shape parameter and a scale parameter. (But we can't easily use the method 
# of moments here right now.)

# Estimate the shape and scale parameters for a weibull distribution
sw %>% fitdistr(densfun = "weibull")

# Question:
#
# You've been recruited to evaluate the frequency of Corgi sightings in the 
# Ithaca Downtown. A sample of 10 students each reported the number of corgis 
# they saw last Tuesday in town. Calculate the statistics summarizing each 
# distribution, if it were a normal, poisson, exponential, gamma, or weibull 
# distribution. Please use fitdistr for all your calculations.
#
# Beth saw 5, Javier saw 1, June saw 10(!), Tim saw 3, Melanie saw 4, 
# Mohammad saw 3, Jenny say 6, Yosuke saw 4, Jimena saw 5, and David saw 2.
#

# View Answer!
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First, let's make the data.

# Make distribution of Corgis
corgi = c(5, 1, 10, 3, 4, 3, 6, 4, 5, 2)

# Next, let's compute the estimated statistics using maximum likelihood 
# estimation.

# Compute statistics for each distributions
corgi %>% fitdistr(densfun = "normal")
corgi %>% fitdistr(densfun = "poisson")
corgi %>% fitdistr(densfun = "exponential")
corgi %>% fitdistr(densfun = "gamma")
corgi %>% fitdistr(densfun = "weibull")
