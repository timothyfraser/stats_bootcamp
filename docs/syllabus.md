## 📖 COURSE DESCRIPTION

This boot camp is intended to prepare students for the mathematics, probability, and statistics used in the class **SYSEN 5200: Systems Analysis Behavior and Optimization** and in **SYSEN 5300: Systems Engineering and Six Sigma**. It is intended for participants who have a limited background in mathematics, and for participants who have not used mathematics recently and need a refresher course.

The boot camp will give students a working knowledge of basic probability and statistics and their application to engineering. There will also be several programming modules at the end to serve as an introduction or refresher in the use of the programming languages **R** and/or **Python** to help the student perform simulations in SYSEN 5200 or 5300.

## 🎯 COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES

1. **Analyze Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations**
2. **Evaluate Probabilities, Distributions, and Simulation**
3. **Analyze Inferential Statistics**
4. **Evaluate Statistical Significance and Confidence Intervals**
5. **Code Basic Statistical Analyses in an Open-Source Coding Language**

## 📊 GRADING PRACTICES & POLICIES

> **Note:** This boot camp is **not graded**, nor is it for credit.

### Learning Check Assignment
Each week, there will be **Learning Check quizzes** - these are not handed in; instead, participants will receive the solutions and can self-assess their progress.

### Proficiency Assessments
There will also be **proficiency assessment examinations**, which are entirely optional. If you choose to take the proficiency assessment examinations, they will be graded and the scores reported to you.

### You Choose
You can choose to select a subset of the offered topics, depending on your needs. You do not have to work on all of the topics. Some of the topics do naturally follow earlier subjects, so be careful how you pick and choose, of course.

### 💡 Tips
- **Find a Calculator!** I suggest that you get a good scientific calculator if you do not have one. You can certainly use the computer to do math, but a calculator is often handy and portable.
- **Collaborate!** Collaboration is allowed and encouraged on homework assignments! Collaboration is discouraged on the proficiency examinations.
